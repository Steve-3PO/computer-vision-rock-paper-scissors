# Computer Vision (AiCore training): Rock-Paper-Scissors!

[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

## Overview 
> - This is an implementation of an interactive "Rock Paper Scissors" game in which the user can play with the computer using a webcam to record the user's selection. 
> - The Model used can be accessed from Teachable-Machine and the download is shown in the repository under the file named keras_model.h5 with the corresponding labels in the labels.txt file.

## Learning Objectives
> - To create a (small) image database for computer vision tasks.
> - To set up a virtual environment and understand the installation of all required packages.
> - A tool to practice intermediate Python programming - 'if-else' statements, 'while' loops, and object oriented programming.

## Project Structure

### Milestone 1 - "Create the Computer Vision System"
> - Create the dataset (images) to be used in training the model
> - Create the model using Teachable Machine.

### Milestone 2 - "Install the Dependencies"
> - Create the conda virtual environment
> - Package Installation 

### Milestone 3 - "Create a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game"
> - Get users choice and randomly generate computer's choice
> - Determine the winner
> - Simulate the game

### Milestone 4 - "Use the Camera to play Rock-Paper-Scissors"
> - Get user prediction with model
> - Initiate countdown
> - Other additions

## M1 - Create the computer Vision System

To create our vision system we must first distinguish between the 4 different types of inputs that the system is required to differentiate. Rock, Paper, Scissors and None. It is important to note that none is simply the lack of any input by the user and is itself an input because of this.
