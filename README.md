# Computer Vision RPS

## This project will show how a model can be trained to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with a computer using a webcam to record the user's selection. 
> The Model can be accessed from Teachable-Machine and the download is the file names keras_model.h5 with the corresponding labels in the labels.txt file.

### Milestone 2
> The model was trained using over 1000+ pictures for each of the possible inpputs: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing, for when there is a lack of input from the user. The model was then downloaded and imported into this repository to begin accessing it.
